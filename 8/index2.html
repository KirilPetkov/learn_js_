<!-- You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.

The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.
External scripts cannot contain
<script> tags.
External JavaScript Advantages
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

It separates HTML and code
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
To add several script files to one page - use several script tags:
<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
<script src="myScript2.js"></script>

External References
An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

With a full URL (a full web address)
With a file path (like /js/)
Without any path
This example uses a full URL to link to myScript.js:

check >> index3.html

This example uses a file path to link to myScript.js:

check >> index4.html

This example uses no path to link to myScript.js:

check >> index5.html
